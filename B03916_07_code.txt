Shared Storage 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of GlusterFS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration of GlusterFS for Block Storage 
Following are the steps for configuration of GlusterFS

Installation of GlusterFS
Following command must be typed on the terminal to install a GlusterFS
| sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server

Then ensure that GlusterFS was properly installed on two nodes (controller_1 and controller _2) using following  command 
| sudo glusterfs –version

On successful installation, we will get the following result 
Configuration of nodes for communication 
Now both the server wants to communicate each other by editing the entries in the /etc/hosts using 
| sudo gedit /etc/hosts

Now we need to run the following command on both the nodes

| Sudo gluster peer probe gluster1
| Sudo gluster peer probe gluster2
 
On successful communication of these nodes we will ensure that the Gluster nodes are properly communicating with each other. 
Status of Peers
Then we have to check the status of peers on two severs using as follows. On server 1, we have to check the peer status  by following command
| sudo gluster peer status

On server 2 , we have to check the peer status by following command 

| sudo gluster peer status

Number of Peers: 1
Hostname: gluster2
Port: 24007
Uuid: 5c5a045c-34b9-44ac-b5c0-8acb461d8523
State: Peer in Cluster (Connected)

Creation of Data Point 

As an initial step of data appoint creation, we need to create a new directory called gluster under a directory by following command 
| sudo mkdir -p /mnt/gluster

Then we have to create a volume in which we will have all other data resides. This volume is called as data point. After that, we will run the following command on the machines (Servers). 

| sudo gluster  volume create datapoint replica 2 transport tcp  gluster1:/mnt/gluster  gluster2:/mnt/gluster

Start of Volumes 
Then we start the data point volume services using following command 

| sudo gluster volume start datapoint


Finally we have to run the commands to ensure that the GlusterFS is up and running using ps on both of the nodes (Controller_1 an Controller_2)
| sudo ps aux | grep gluster


To make sure of the availability of the volumes run the following Gluster command 

| sudo gluster volume info

Introduction to Ceph 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of Ceph 

Following are the steps for installing Ceph 
Installation of Openssh

Openssh is installing using the command 

| sudo aptitude -y install openssh-server

Then provide the required privileges to the ceph using following command

| sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ceph

Connect to Ceph Node

Ssh pair is created and sends to connect to ceph nodes using non-passphrase using sudo ssh-keygen. Then Configuration file of .ssh file is to be edited as follows 

| sudo vi ~/.ssh/config

Then send the ssh key to the ceph nodes as follows 

Send this key for all other nodes using the following commands 

| sudo ssh-copy-id ceph02
| sudo ssh-copy-id ceph02

 Configure Ceph Node

Ceph configuration must be done on the servers as follows 

| sudo aptitude -y install ceph-deploy ceph-common ceph-mds

Configure Storage Node 

Then we configure the storage node on the server. In our scenario, we have to create directories /storage01, /storage02 and /storage03 on all the nodes ceph01, ceph02 and ceph03 as follows 

| sudo  ceph-deploy osd prepare ceph01:/storage01 ceph02:/storage02 ceph03:/storage03

| sudo ceph-deploy osd activate ceph01:/storage01 ceph02:/storage02 ceph03:/storage03



 Checking the status of Ceph

 Finally, we check the status of the ceph with the following command

 | sudo ceph mds stat
