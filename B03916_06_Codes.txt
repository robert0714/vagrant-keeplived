Distributed Networking

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of high availability Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control Node setup
-------------------
Following is the procedure for control note setup
•	SQL server with neutron DB and neutron server.conf file must be configured 
•	The message queue service and neutron-server.conf file configuration must be done according to the message queue server.
•	Configuration must be done in the neutron-server.conf file according to the OpenStack Identity service. 
•	Nova.conf file is also configured for adopting the OpenStack compute services and neutron server service and ML2 plug-in and its dependencies 

Disable reverse path filtering

The kernel needs to be configured to disable the reverse path filtering by editing the file under /etc directory using any one of the editors (such as vi, nano and gedit etc.,) and change the values of the attributes net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter to zero.

| sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf


 Loading of new kernel 

The new kernel must be loaded with a help of configuration of the kernel file as follows.
| sudo sysctl -p

Configuration of Neutron

 We need to configure the neutron file by changing the following base configurations using a neutron.conf file under /etc/neutron

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/neutron.conf

Configuration ML-2 plug-in 

We have to change the VLAN and VXLAN according to our environment as follows
Restart the servers 

Restart the services to made the changes over the servers using following command

| sudo service openstack-neutron restart

----------------------------
Network Node setup
-----------------------------
Following is the procedure for network note setup
•	Configuration must be done in the neutron-server.conf file according to the OpenStack Identity service. 
•	ML2 plug-in, L3 agent, Open vSwitch agent, metadata agent, Open vSwitch service,  DHCP agent, and dependencies.

Packet forward enabling and Disable reverse path filtering 
The kernel needs to be configured to disable the reverse path filtering and enabling packet forwarding by editing the file under /etc/ directory using any one of the editors (such as vi, nano and gedit etc.,) and change the values of the attributes net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter to zero then change the value to 1 of an attribute called net.ipv4.ip_forward.

Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file using following command

| sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf


Loading of new kernel 

The new kernel must be loaded with a help of configuration of the kernel file as follows.

| sudo sysctl -p

Configuration of Neutron

 We need to configure the neutron file by changing the following base configurations using a neutron.conf file under /etc/neutron 

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/neutron.conf

Configuration ML-2 plug-in 
Configure the ML2 plug-in by using one of the editors vi, nano and gedit as follows

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini 

We have to change the VLAN and VXLAN according to our environment as follows
Configure the L3 agent
Configure the L3 agent by editing using one of the editors as follows and change the  external_network_bridge option will have no value.

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/l3_agent.ini

Configure the DHCP agent

Configure the DHCP agent by editing using one of the editors as follows 

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/dhcp_agent.ini


Configure the metadata agent

Configure the metadata agent by editing using one of the editors as follows and change the METADATA_SECRET value according to our environment.

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/metadata_agent.ini

Then change the METADATA_SECRET with a suitable value according to our environment 
Restart services

Then the services (Open vSwitch, Open vSwitch agent, L3 agent, DHCP agent, Metadata agent and neutron) are restarted as follows to reflect the changes as follows. 

| sudo service neutron-server restart
| sudo service neutron-dhcp-agent restart
| sudo service neutron-l3-agent restart
| sudo neutron-metadata-agent restart
| sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

------------------------------------------------------
Compute Node Setup
--------------------------------------------------------

Following is the procedure for compute node setup
•	Configuration must be done in the neutron-server.conf file according to the OpenStack Identity service. 
•	Configuration must be done in the neutron-server.conf file according to the openstack computer hypervisor service.
•	ML2 plug-in, L3 agent, Open vSwitch agent, metadata agent, Open vSwitch service, DHCP agent, and dependencies.

Packet forward enabling and Disable reverse path filtering 

The kernel needs to be configured to disable the reverse path filtering and enabling packet forwarding by editing the file under /etc/ directory using any one of the editors (such as vi, nano and gedit etc.,) and change the values of the attributes net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter to zero then change the value to 1 of an attribute called net.ipv4.ip_forward.

Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file using following command 

| sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf

Loading of new kernel 

The new kernel must be loaded with a help of configuration of the kernel file as follows.

| sudo sysctl -p

Configuration of Neutron

 We need to configure the neutron file by changing the following base configurations using a neutron.conf file under /etc/neutron

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/neutron.conf

And change the value of router_distributed = true
Configuration ML-2 plug-in 

Configure the ML2 plug-in by using one of the editors vi, nano and gedit as follows 

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini 

We have to change the VLAN and VXLAN according to our environment as follows

Configure the L3 agent

Configure the L3 agent by editing using one of the editors as follows and change the  external_network_bridge option will have no value.

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/l3_agent.ini

Configure the metadata agent

Configure the metadata agent by editing using one of the editors as follows and change the METADATA_SECRET value according to our environment as follows 

| sudo gedit /etc/neutron/metadata_agent.ini

Then change the METADATA_SECRET with a suitable value according to our environment 

 Restart services

Then the services (Open vSwitch, Open vSwitch agent, L3 agent, Metadata agent) are restarted as follows to reflect the changes as follows. 
| sudo service neutron-server restart
| sudo service neutron-l3-agent restart
| sudo neutron-metadata-agent restart
| sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

Verification of service operation

Presence and operations of the agents are verified with following command 

| sudo neutron agent-list
